Simple Functional Library for C++

- Inspired by Haskell
- Inspired by https://github.com/beark/ftl, which was in turn also inspired for Haskell
- Totally header based for easy inclusion
- C++11 compliant compiler is a must.
- gcc, clang, and Visual Studio 2013 compatibility
- We add features as needed
- This library makes it easier to program in functional style. The implementation of the library itself is not necessarily functional in nature, due to efficency reasons.
- Pull requests are welcome
- Documentation are in the header files. For getting started, see Prelude.h


This library is used in production in the following project: (I would be glad to add other items to this list in the future, be it closed or open source, let me know if you have one!)
