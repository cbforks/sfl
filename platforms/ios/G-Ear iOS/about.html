The LGPL version 2.1<br/>===<br/><br/><br/>  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>       Version 2.1, February 1999<br/><br/> Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br/> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br/> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br/> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br/><br/>[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br/> as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br/> the version number 2.1.]<br/><br/>    Preamble<br/><br/>  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br/>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br/>Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br/>free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br/><br/>  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br/>specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br/>Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br/>can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br/>this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br/>strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br/><br/>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br/>not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br/>you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br/>for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br/>it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br/>it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br/>these things.<br/><br/>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br/>distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br/>rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br/>you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br/><br/>  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br/>or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br/>you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br/>code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br/>complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br/>with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br/>it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br/><br/>  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br/>library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br/>permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br/><br/>  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br/>there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br/>modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br/>that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br/>author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br/>introduced by others.<br/><br/>  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br/>any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br/>effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br/>restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br/>any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br/>consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br/><br/>  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br/>ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br/>General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br/>is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br/>this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br/>libraries into non-free programs.<br/><br/>  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br/>a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br/>combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br/>General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br/>entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br/>Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br/>the library.<br/><br/>  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it<br/>does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General<br/>Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br/>of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br/>are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br/>libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br/>special circumstances.<br/><br/>  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br/>encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br/>a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br/>allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br/>library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br/>case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br/>software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br/><br/>  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br/>programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br/>free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br/>non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br/>operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br/>system.<br/><br/>  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br/>users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br/>linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br/>that program using a modified version of the Library.<br/><br/>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br/>modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br/>&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The<br/>former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br/>be combined with the library in order to run.<br/><br/>  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br/><br/>  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br/>program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br/>other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br/>this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).<br/>Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br/><br/>  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data<br/>prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br/>(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br/><br/>  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work<br/>which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the<br/>Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under<br/>copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br/>portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br/>straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br/>included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)<br/><br/>  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br/>making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br/>all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br/>interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br/>and installation of the library.<br/><br/>  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br/>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br/>running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br/>such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br/>on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br/>writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br/>and what the program that uses the Library does.<br/>  <br/>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's<br/>complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br/>you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br/>appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br/>all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br/>warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br/>Library.<br/><br/>  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br/>and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br/>fee.<br/><br/>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br/>of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br/>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br/>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br/><br/>    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br/><br/>    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br/>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br/><br/>    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br/>    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br/><br/>    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br/>    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br/>    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br/>    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br/>    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br/>    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br/>    its purpose remains meaningful.<br/><br/>    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br/>    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br/>    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br/>    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br/>    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br/>    root function must still compute square roots.)<br/><br/>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br/>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br/>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br/>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br/>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br/>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br/>on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br/>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br/>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br/>it.<br/><br/>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br/>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br/>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br/>collective works based on the Library.<br/><br/>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br/>with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br/>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br/>the scope of this License.<br/><br/>  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br/>License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br/>this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br/>that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br/>instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br/>ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br/>that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br/>these notices.<br/><br/>  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br/>that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br/>subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br/><br/>  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br/>the Library into a program that is not a library.<br/><br/>  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br/>derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br/>under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br/>it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br/>must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br/>medium customarily used for software interchange.<br/><br/>  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br/>from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br/>source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br/>distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br/>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br/><br/>  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br/>Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br/>linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a<br/>work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br/>therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br/><br/>  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library<br/>creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br/>contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the<br/>library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br/>Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br/><br/>  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file<br/>that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br/>derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br/>Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br/>linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br/>threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br/><br/>  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br/>structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br/>functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br/>file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br/>work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br/>Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br/><br/>  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br/>distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br/>Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br/>whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br/><br/>  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br/>link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a<br/>work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br/>under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br/>modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse<br/>engineering for debugging such modifications.<br/><br/>  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br/>Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br/>this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br/>during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br/>copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br/>directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br/>of these things:<br/><br/>    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br/>    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br/>    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br/>    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br/>    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that<br/>    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the<br/>    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br/>    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br/>    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br/>    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br/>    to use the modified definitions.)<br/><br/>    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br/>    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br/>    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,<br/>    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br/>    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br/>    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br/>    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br/><br/>    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br/>    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br/>    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br/>    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br/><br/>    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br/>    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br/>    specified materials from the same place.<br/><br/>    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br/>    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br/><br/>  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the<br/>Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for<br/>reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br/>the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br/>normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br/>components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br/>which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br/>the executable.<br/><br/>  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br/>restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br/>accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br/>use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br/>distribute.<br/><br/>  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br/>Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br/>facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br/>library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br/>the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br/>permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br/><br/>    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br/>    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br/>    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br/>    Sections above.<br/><br/>    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br/>    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br/>    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br/><br/>  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br/>the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br/>attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br/>distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br/>rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br/>or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br/>terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br/><br/>  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br/>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br/>distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br/>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br/>modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br/>Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br/>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br/>the Library or works based on it.<br/><br/>  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br/>Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br/>original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br/>subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br/>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br/>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br/>this License.<br/><br/>  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br/>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br/>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br/>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br/>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br/>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br/>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br/>may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br/>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br/>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br/>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br/>refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br/><br/>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br/>particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br/>and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br/><br/>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br/>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br/>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br/>integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br/>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br/>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br/>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br/>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br/>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br/>impose that choice.<br/><br/>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br/>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br/><br/>  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br/>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br/>original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br/>an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br/>so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br/>excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br/>written in the body of this License.<br/><br/>  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br/>versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br/>Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br/>but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br/><br/>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br/>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br/>&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and<br/>conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br/>the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br/>license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br/>the Free Software Foundation.<br/><br/>  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br/>programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br/>write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br/>copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br/>Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br/>decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br/>of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br/>and reuse of software generally.<br/><br/>    NO WARRANTY<br/><br/>  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br/>WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br/>EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br/>OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br/>KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br/>IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br/>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br/>LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br/>THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br/><br/>  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br/>WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br/>AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br/>FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br/>CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br/>LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br/>RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br/>FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br/>SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br/>DAMAGES.<br/><br/>     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/><br/>===<br/>2.

This<br/>General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br/>Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br/>using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br/>the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br/>your programs, too.<br/><br/>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br/>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br/>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br/>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br/>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br/>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br/><br/>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br/>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br/>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br/>distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br/><br/>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br/>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br/>you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br/>source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br/>rights.<br/><br/>  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br/>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br/>distribute and/or modify the software.<br/><br/>  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br/>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br/>software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br/>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br/>that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br/>authors' reputations.<br/><br/>  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br/>patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br/>program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br/>program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br/>patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br/><br/>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br/>modification follow.<br/><br/>    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br/>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br/><br/>  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br/>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br/>under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,<br/>refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;<br/>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br/>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br/>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br/>language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br/>the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br/><br/>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br/>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br/>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br/>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br/>Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br/>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br/><br/>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br/>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br/>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br/>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br/>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br/>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br/>along with the Program.<br/><br/>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br/>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br/><br/>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br/>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br/>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br/>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br/><br/>    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br/>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br/><br/>    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br/>    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br/>    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br/>    parties under the terms of this License.<br/><br/>    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br/>    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br/>    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br/>    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br/>    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br/>    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br/>    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br/>    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br/>    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br/>    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br/><br/>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br/>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br/>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br/>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br/>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br/>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br/>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br/>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br/>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br/><br/>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br/>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br/>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br/>collective works based on the Program.<br/><br/>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br/>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br/>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br/>the scope of this License.<br/><br/>  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br/>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br/>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br/><br/>    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br/>    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br/>    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br/><br/>    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br/>    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br/>    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br/>    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br/>    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br/>    customarily used for software interchange; or,<br/><br/>    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br/>    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br/>    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br/>    received the program in object code or executable form with such<br/>    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br/><br/>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br/>making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br/>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br/>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br/>control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br/>special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br/>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br/>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br/>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br/>itself accompanies the executable.<br/><br/>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br/>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br/>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br/>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br/>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br/><br/>  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br/>except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br/>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br/>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br/>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br/>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br/>parties remain in full compliance.<br/><br/>  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br/>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br/>distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br/>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br/>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br/>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br/>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br/>the Program or works based on it.<br/><br/>  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br/>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br/>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br/>these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br/>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br/>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br/>this License.<br/><br/>  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br/>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br/>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br/>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br/>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br/>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br/>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br/>may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br/>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br/>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br/>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br/>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br/><br/>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br/>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br/>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br/>circumstances.<br/><br/>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br/>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br/>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br/>integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br/>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br/>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br/>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br/>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br/>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br/>impose that choice.<br/><br/>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br/>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br/><br/>  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br/>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br/>original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br/>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br/>those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br/>countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br/>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br/><br/>  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br/>of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br/>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br/>address new problems or concerns.<br/><br/>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br/>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any<br/>later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br/>either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br/>Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br/>this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br/>Foundation.<br/><br/>  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br/>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br/>to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br/>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br/>make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br/>of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br/>of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br/><br/>    NO WARRANTY<br/><br/>  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br/>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br/>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br/>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br/>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br/>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br/>TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br/>PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br/>REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br/><br/>  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br/>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br/>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br/>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br/>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br/>TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br/>YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br/>PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br/>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br/><br/>     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br/><br/>Expat<br/><br/>http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html<br/><br/>Expat License.
