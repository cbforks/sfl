Simple Functional Library for C++

- Inspired by Haskell
- Inspired by https://github.com/beark/ftl, which was in turn also inspired for Haskell
- Totally header based for easy inclusion
- Visual Studio 2013 compatibility is a goal (almost met)
- Does require boost currently, however this will change
- We add features as needed
- Pull requests are welcome
